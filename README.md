# Movies App

## Project Structure

This project may appear to have a very large structure for its size. However, this deliberate choice was made to demonstrate my proficiency in organizing and architecting code effectively. While the project itself may be small in scale, the structure employed reflects my commitment to writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
